//you are required to square every digits of tghe number.
//for example if we run 9119 through the function,811181 will come out,because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1
//you might know some pretty large perfect squares.But about the next one?

//question 2
/*complete the findnextsquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a a parameter.
recall that an integral perfect squares is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer*/
//if the parameter is itself not a perfect square,than -1 should be returne. You may assume the parameter is positive.
